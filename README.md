Title: y_Finance SQL Project: Data Collection, Analysis, and Querying

Description:

Welcome to the y_Finance SQL Project repository! Here, you'll find a comprehensive exploration of financial data utilizing SQL queries, data collection via API, and analysis performed in Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging the powerful capabilities of SQL alongside data fetched from the y_Finance API. By combining these technologies, we enable efficient data retrieval, storage, and analysis of financial information.

Key Features:

Data Collection via API: We utilize the y_Finance API to fetch real-time financial data, ensuring the accuracy and relevancy of our datasets.

Jupyter Notebook Integration: All aspects of this project, including data collection, database creation, and query execution, are seamlessly integrated within Jupyter Notebook environment. This ensures a cohesive and interactive workflow for users.

Database Management: Using SQL commands within Jupyter Notebook, we create and manage the database where the collected financial data is stored. This facilitates easy access and manipulation of the data for further analysis.

Query Execution: Through SQL queries executed within Jupyter Notebook, we perform various analyses and extract valuable insights from the financial data. These queries are designed to address specific research questions or to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.
